                                                <li>has a plugin system that makes it easy to extend and use to build
                                                    common web page elements, such as a lightbox or carousel widget.

                                                <li>They both provide a large number of utility functions under the
                                                    namespace _ (this is where they get their name from as the _
                                                    character is often referred to as an 'underscore' or a 'lodash').

                                                    that many tasks can be accomplished with a similar amount of code
                                                    but much better performance. This is now truer than ever since ES6,
                                                    as a lot of problems that some libraries addressed have been fixed
                                                    in the vanilla flavor of JavaScript. </li>

                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Using a library means you can be confident that your code will be as
                                                    bullet-proof as possible in many browsers.</li>
                                                <li>In addition, there will usually be lots of online documentation and
                                                    a strong community ready to help out if you become stuck.</li>

                                        <li>Disadvantages
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>You need to include the code for the library as well as your own
                                                    code. This increases the amount of code that needs to be downloaded
                                                    by a website, which in some cases can cause performance issues.</li>
                                                <li>Another problem with libraries is that they might fail to implement
                                                    the functionality in the precise way that you want it to perform.

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and
                                            methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.</li>
                                        <li>A ES6 module file is just a normal JavaScript file, but uses the keyword
                                            export to specify any values or functions that are to be made available from
                                            the module.</li>
                                        <li>Node.js Modules</li>
                                    </ol>
