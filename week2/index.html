                        <li>string properties and methods
                            <p>• Technically, only objects have properties and methods. JavaScript overcomes this by
                                creating wrapper objects for primitive data types. This all happens in the background,
                                so for all intents and purposes it appears that primitive data types also have
                                properties and methods.</p>
                            <p>• We can access the properties of a string using dot notation. This involves writing a
                                dot followed by the property we are interested in. </p>
                            <p>• An alternative notation you can use to access a primitive data type's properties are
                                square brackets, e.g. name['length'];</p>
                            <p>• All properties of primitive data types are immutable, meaning they’re unable to be
                                changed.</p>
                            <p>• A method is an action that a primitive data type or object can perform. To call a
                                method, we use the dot operator (.) followed by the name of the method, followed by
                                parentheses (this is a useful way to distinguish between a property and a method ―
                                methods end with parentheses). For example, we can write a string in all capital letters
                                using the toUpperCase() method</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>concat() or the + operator for shortcut
                            <p>• 'Hello'.concat(' ','World','!');<br>
                                << 'Hello World!' </p> <p>• 'Java' + 'Script' + ' ' + 'Ninja';<br>
                                    << 'JavaScript Ninja' </p> </li> <li>Template Literals, i.e. backtick character `
                        </li>
                        <p>• `She said, "It's Me!"`</p>
                        <p>• `This character, \`, is a backtick`</p>
                        <li>interpolation</li>
                        <p>• const age = 39;<br>
                            `I will be ${ age + 1 } next year`;<br>
                            << 'I will be 40 next year' </p> <li>Symbol()</li>
                                <p>• const uniqueID = Symbol('this is a unique ID');</p>
                                <li>Octal and Hexadecimal Numbers</li>
                                <li>Number Methods</li>
                                <p>• Numbers also have some built-in methods, although you need to be careful when using
                                    the dot notation with number literals that are integers because JavaScript will
                                    confuse the dot with a decimal point. </p>
                                <li>Type coercion</li>
                                <p>• '2' * 8;<br>
                                    << 16</p> <p>• Better change the type manually rather than relying on type coercion
                                </p>
                                <li>converting strings to numbers</li>
                                <p>• Number('23')</p>
                                <li>Functions</li>
                                <p>• All functions return a value, which can be specified using the return statement,
                                    which comes after the return keyword. A function that doesn’t explicitly return
                                    anything (such as all the examples we have seen so far) will return undefined by
                                    default.</p>
                                function howdy(){<br>
                                return 'Howdy World!';<br>
                                This means we can now assign a function invocation to a variable, and the value of that
                                variable will be the return value of that function:<br>
                                const message = howdy();<br>
                                << 'Howdy World!' <br>
                                    }
                                    <p>• Parameters and arguments are terms that are often used interchangeably to
                                        represent values provided for the function as an input. There is a subtle
                                        difference though: any parameters a function needs are set when the function is
                                        defined. When a function is invoked, it is provided with arguments. In the body
                                        of the function, the name of the parameter acts like a variable equal to the
                                        value that is provided when the function is invoked. When we invoke this
                                        function, we need to provide an argument</p>
                                    function square(x){<br>
                                    return x*x;<br>
                                    }
                                    square(4.5);<br>
                                    << 20.25<br>
                                        <p>• You can use as many parameters as you like when defining functions. If a
                                            parameter is not provided as an argument when the function is invoked, the
                                            function will still be invoked, but the parameter will be given a value of
                                            undefined. If too many arguments are provided when a function is invoked,
                                            the
                                            function will work as normal and the extra arguments will be ignored
                                            (although they can be accessed using the arguments </p>
                        </p>
                        <p>• Every function has a special variable called arguments. This is an array-like object that
                            contains every argument passed to the function when it is invoked. We can create a simple
                            function called arguments() that will return the arguments object so we can see what it
                            contains:</p>
                        <p>• rest operator is a much better option to borrow methods from arrays because arguments is
                            not an array. The args parameter is an actual array, and has access to the same methods.
                            <br>
                            function rest(...args){<br>
                            return args;<br>
                            }
                        </p>
                        <p>• We can use a rest parameter to improve our mean() function so it accepts any number of
                            values:<br>
                            function mean(...values) {<br>
                            let total = 0;<br>
                            for(const value of values) {<br>
                            total += value;<br>
                            }<br>
                            return total/values.length;<br>
                            }
                        </p>
                        <p>• Remember at the start of this chapter when we said that functions in JavaScript are
                            first-class objects, so they behave in just the same way as every other object? This means
                            that functions can also be given as a parameter to another function. A function that is
                            passed as an argument to another is known as a callback.</p>
                            <p>• We can make the sing() function more flexible by adding a callback parameter. The callback is provided as a parameter, then invoked inside the body of the function.<br>
                                function sing(song,callback) {<br>
                                    console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}.`);<br>
                                    callback();<br>
                                }
                            </p>
                            <p>• It’s often a better idea to keep functions separate and named, so they can be reused. </p>
                   <p>• Arrow functions make perfect candidates for short, anonymous functions</p>
                        </ol>
