                                    <p>• The DOM starts with a root object called Window. So any global objects are all
                                        children or
                                        properties of the Window object. You can think of window as the container for
                                        all of your
                                        JavaScript objects.

                                    <p>• Best practices since ES6: Use let for all variables and const for all object
                                        variables. Keep variables closely scoped to only what visibility it needs. Use
                                        var sparingly.</p>

                                <li>The type of loop specifically designed to work with arrays is called
                                    a ‘for loop.</li>
                                <li>How then can you get a value out of an array?
                                    <p>• var aNumber = someNumbers[1];</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>i is a variable to keep track of the location you are at in the array. By tradition,
                                    the location tracker is named ‘i’. It stands for ‘index.’ It does
                                    defy the ‘name things what they are’ and ‘don’t use single character variable names’
                                    rules.</li>
                                <li>The += operator takes the thing on its right-hand side and adds it to whatever is in
                                    the variable on the left-hand side.</li>

                            <li>A function that is a property of an object is called its method. So, here we’ve got a
                                method sayHi of the object user.</li>
                            <li>When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called
                                object-oriented programming, in short: “OOP”.</li>
                            <li>As demonstrated, we can omit "function" and just write sayHi().<br>sayHi() {} //same as
                                "sayHi: function(){...}"

                            </li>
                            <li>In almost all cases the shorter syntax is preferred.</li>
                            <li>To access the object, a method can use the "this" keyword. this.name instead of
                                user.name</li>
                            <li>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.</li>
                            <li>Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().</li>
                            <li>Methods can reference the object as this.</li>

                            <li>An object literal is an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all
                                its properties and methods in curly braces {}. Object literals are a distinguishing
                                feature of the JavaScript language, as they allow objects to be created quickly without
                                the need for defining a class. They also provide a useful way of organizing your code
                                without polluting the global namespace.</li>
                            <li>To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces: const spiderman = {};
                                OR const spiderman = new Object(); //former is object literal notation, latter is object
                                constructor (not recommended)</li>
                            <li>Accessing properties: dot notation or bracket notation: superman.name OR
                                superman['name']
                                <p>• Dot notation is much more common, but bracket notation has a few advantages: it's
                                    the only way to access nonstandard property and method names that don’t follow the
                                    variable naming rules.</p>

                            <li>When we create variables or functions in a global scope, they're called variables and
                                functions. But when we create variables and functions inside an object, they're called
                                properties and methods.</li>

                            <li>With functions, when we want to pass in outside data, we use parameters that get
                                referred to inside the function.</li>
                            <li>The value of a property has always been allowed to be a JavaScript expression: const
                                captainBritain = { name: 'Captain Britain', hero: bewitched ? false : true };</li>
                            <li>The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three
                                operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if
                                the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute
                                if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an
                                if...else statement.
                            <p>• condition ? expr1 : expr2</p>
                        <p>• console.log((age >= 18)) ? "You are an adult!" : "You are a kid."</p></li>
