/*Each element in the array contains information about the superheroes used in our quiz. These objects replace the nested arrays we used in the previous chapters, and have properties of name and realName that will be used to form the questions and answers.

Now weâ€™re going to namespace the functions we created in the last chapter. We do this by placing them inside an object called game that will be the namespace. This means that any references to the functions need to be replaced with game.function() outside the object or this.function() inside the object.*/
