                    <li>What did I do since the last meeting?</li>
                    <p>I read "Doing Stuff with Web Things" from the beginning until Chapter 3 and did a couple of exercises. I watched Master Mobile UX but I was not able to meet with my teammates for discussion because we weren't able to set a meeting earlier. I created a new repository on GitHub using my existing account. </p>
                    <li>What am I going to do next?</li>
                    <p>I will finish reading "Doing Stuff with Web Things" next week. I really need to familiarize JS to the letter.</p>
                    <li>What are my blockers?</li>
                    <p>I tend to get mental block when it comes to JS for some reason :( I feel that I'm not meant for programming sometimes, only at web designing.</p>
